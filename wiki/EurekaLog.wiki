!EurekaLog is the new Delphi and C++Builder add-in tool that gives your application (GUI, Console, Web, etc.) the power to catch all exceptions, memory leaks and detect infinite-loops and deadlocks. It generates a detailed log of the call stack at the point that raised the exception, showing unit, class, method and line no., (see this [http://www.eurekalog.com/showlog.php example]), and displays it on screen and optionally sends it back to you via email or Web message (using the HTTP-S/FTP protocols or sending directly to your preferred "Web Bug Traking" tool), thus helping speed up the process of bug-location and resolution by a factor of 10!

It is used by History++ plugin to generate debug binaties.
