### Why do I need all these plugins to customize my history??? ###

It's true that in History++ 1.4 you could change fonts and colors without installing additional plugins. However, this has changed in the 1.5.x versions. We have two excuses for such change:

  * As we moved options dialog to the miranda options, it was very time-consuming to transfer all the settings connected with the grid customization. So, we have chosen to "outsource" the settings customization to the respective plugins which aim to become some kind of "hubs" for changing fonts, colors and icons in miranda.

  * We believe that having one place in miranda for changing fonts and icons for all plugins is the right thing to do. Miranda  has a long-standing problem of messed-up options, where you just can't find the correct option. You browse through numerious plugins' option pages trying to find the one you need. Introducing one page for fonts, where you can change all the fonts in all miranda's plugins is a big advantage to the whole miranda infrastructure and we try to use it and support it. The same with icons options.
